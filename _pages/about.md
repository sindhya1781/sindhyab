Hi, my name is Sindhya Balasubramanian. I am an AI enthusiast - currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science at Northeastern University. My passion for the subject ebbs from five years of work experience with large technology consulting companies focused on Data Analytics, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, Hypothesis Testing and Business Analytics. I am quick to my feet and love breaking problems down to understand what's really happening behind the closed problem doors.   

I have strong foundations in Data Science, Analytics and Machine Learning. I have worked with a wide range of languages (inclusive of R, Octave, MATLAB, and Tableau) and specializes in Python (numpy, pandas, pyplot, scapy, scikit learn, keras, pmdarima), SQL, R (ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, caret, mice, stats) and Excel. As a part of my graduate degree, I am taking my understanding of ML and Deep learning concepts up a notch with courses such as Foundations of AI, Supervised Machine Learning and Introduction to Data Management and Processing that provide me with a lens to look at real business problems up close and from 30 feet away.

In my free time, you will find me either holed up in a library or having spirited discussions with my peers on up and coming papers and findings in the field of ML. There is no inbetween.
